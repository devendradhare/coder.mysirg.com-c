// 17. Print all factors of number
// Statement:Any  number we divide using formula  "dividend ÷ divisor =quotient". For Example,12 ÷ 3 = 4, here 12 is dividend 3 is the divisor and 4 is quotient.

// If we divide 12 by 5 like12 ÷ 5then quotient will be 2 but we also get remainder= 2. So here 5 is also a divisor of 12 but it is not dividing 12 completely.

// A factor is a special divisor that divides an integer completely (remainder should be zero).

// So, your task is to write a program such that it finds all the factors F(i) (including1 and N) of a number N and print them strictly in increasing order.

// Input:first line contains an integer N from STDIN.

// Output:print all factors F(i) of N in increasing order each separated by a space

// Constraints:1<=N<=10000

// Example:

// 4

// 1 2 4
